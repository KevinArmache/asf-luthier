His instruments are quite large but still relatively light, they are very balanced, and have clear and full trebbles.",

He developped the asymmetrical fan bracing, his instruments feature eight struts (instead of the traditional seven), with the additional bracing on the \"trebble\" side of the soundboard. The original guitar from 1917 belongs to Catherine Marlat's collection in Paris. It is one of my favourite instruments, with an incredibly colourful, warm and full sound. Although it is not a particularly loud instrument, I would highly recommand this model if you are looking for a complex and rich sound.",

Antonio de Torres (1817-1892) can be considered as the \"father\" of the Spanish classical guitar, developping the \"fan bracing\" system. His instruments are light, have a very thin top, and are characterised by a \"percussive\" bass, warm trebbles, and an overall very \"round\" sound. The pictures hereafter show pegheads, but I can of course build an instrument with machine heads, following the head design of the Torres SE43 that I was able to examin in the musical intrument museum in Paris.",
