This model is based on a guitar made in 1917 by García.

Enrique García (1868-1922) is considered as the founder of the “Barcelona school”, or “Catalan” style of guitar making. He developped the asymmetrical fan bracing, his instruments feature eight struts (instead of the traditional seven), with the additional bracing on the "trebble" side of the soundboard.
The original guitar from 1917 belongs to Catherine Marlat's collection in Paris. It is one of my favourite instruments, with an incredibly colourful, warm and full sound. Although it is not a particularly loud instrument, I would highly recommand this model if you are looking for a complex and rich sound.
