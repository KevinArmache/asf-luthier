This model is based on a guitar made in 1972 by Bouchet.

Robert Bouchet (1898-1986) is one of the most important French luthiers of the twentieth century. He developped the "barre d'Ã¢me", a bracing below the bridge, perpendicular to the grain. His instruments are quite large but still relatively light, they are very balanced, and have clear and full trebbles.
