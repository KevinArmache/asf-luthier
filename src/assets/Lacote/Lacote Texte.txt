Pierre Ren√© Lacote (1785-1871) is the most important luthier of the French Romantic style of guitar making. He had first been a goldsmith, which may explain why his instruments were exceptionnally well made, with a special attention to every detail. Lacote has build guitars for professional musicians and composers, such as Ferdinando Carulli and Fernando Sor.
